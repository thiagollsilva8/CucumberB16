class 1 -

after creating a maven project and added all the dependencies
now we are going to write gherkin test case in cucumber project

every single test case will be considered as one scenario

-- we write scenario in feature file in cucumber

creating features directory under resources to keep all feature files

how to create feature file
right click - file - name of file - test.feature (.feature is the extension)


US-12345
Perform login

class 2 -
recap - cucumber/gherkin/BDD

we write such things in feature file where every test case will be considered as scenario

framework -
build management tool - maven
programming language - java
tool - selenium & cucumber

main - for writing the development code
test - for writing the testing code

technical - java
non technical - resources

US - perform login

Feature: This is the name of my user story
Scenario: This is the name of my test case
Tags- Given, When, And, Then

rules -
never add even a small character or . in your step in feature file after step def
otherwise it will not find the exact linking of the step def

never create duplicate step def for the steps otherwise it will confuse and will
throw an exception

login.feature
Given I am launching the application

add employee.feature
Given I am launching the application

User story - searching an employee in HRMS application

US 121 - search employee by id

US 122 - search employee by name

Class 3 -

recap -
    one user story, we need one feature file
    these scenarios are linked with the step definitions

    we have to write the code/script in the step definition itself

    test runner -
    we use junit-cucumber to run our tests
    cucumber options to provide multiple customizable options

    features - path to all the feature files
    glue - to provide the path of step def package
    dry run - to generate missing step def, when we set it to true, it will generate
    all the step def
    tags - to execute scenarios of our choice, we can use different tags in scenarios

    we use OR keyword in tags to execute either scenario A or scenario B
    (ScenarioA or ScenarioB)
    we use AND keyword in tags to execute the scenario having both conditions true
    (scenarioA and scenarioB), only the test case having both tags will be executed


    login scenario -
        admin login
        ess login
        invalid login

    Background - when the flow of all the scenarios is same in one feature file,
    it will execute before all the scenarios.
    it will be limited to one feature file.
    for every feature file, there will be different background

config.prop - to keep all the configurations related parameters in it
config reader class - read the data from .prop files
constants class - to keep all the paths from this class

Hooks - when we need to write the pre condition and post condition for the
complete project all the test cases, we use hooks.

we have 2 hooks in cucumber-
@before - pre condition of all the test cases
@after - post condition of all the test cases

Rule - we must create hooks class in steps package

Hooks vs Background -
Hooks will execute first and then background will execute
Hooks is same for all the feature file but background is different for all the feature file

order of execution -
first hooks will execute
then background will execute
then test scenario
then hooks will execute

class 4 -

recap -

in the framework, we should not pass any data hard coded -
to pass data we have config.properties file
config reader class - here in this class, we read our data

constants - to keep all the paths of the constants classes and file, we use this class

Background - in one feature file, when the flow is same for all the scenarios, you just
keep these similar steps in background, it is limited to one feature file

Hooks - we have 2 hooks,
@Before - pre condition for the complete project
@After - post condition for the complete project

Hooks must be declared in steps package

test runner -
features,
glue,
dryRun,
tags,
plugin - pretty
monochrome - true

we need to write a function for screenshot which will save my screenshot for all the
test cases with different names so that it will not be overridden

screenshot method in cucumber - here it accepts array of byte for pictures

POM - page object model design pattern
for every screen/page in the application, we create a separate class for it and
keep all the locators/WebElements of this page in this class and we create a key of
locators which we will pass in every step.

class 5 -
recap -
test runner class -

POM - page object model design pattern -

framework characteristics -

it should be easily understandable
it should be expandable
it should be easy to maintain

we created loginpage, employeesearchpage, dashboardpage, addemployeepage

data driven testing - when your one test case executes against multiple set of data
