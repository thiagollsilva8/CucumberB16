class 1 -

after creating a maven project and added all the dependencies
now we are going to write gherkin test case in cucumber project

every single test case will be considered as one scenario

-- we write scenario in feature file in cucumber

creating features directory under resources to keep all feature files

how to create feature file
right click - file - name of file - test.feature (.feature is the extension)


US-12345
Perform login

class 2 -
recap - cucumber/gherkin/BDD

we write such things in feature file where every test case will be considered as scenario

framework -
build management tool - maven
programming language - java
tool - selenium & cucumber

main - for writing the development code
test - for writing the testing code

technical - java
non technical - resources

US - perform login

Feature: This is the name of my user story
Scenario: This is the name of my test case
Tags- Given, When, And, Then

rules -
never add even a small character or . in your step in feature file after step def
otherwise it will not find the exact linking of the step def

never create duplicate step def for the steps otherwise it will confuse and will
throw an exception

login.feature
Given I am launching the application

add employee.feature
Given I am launching the application

User story - searching an employee in HRMS application

US 121 - search employee by id

US 122 - search employee by name

Class 3 -

recap -
    one user story, we need one feature file
    these scenarios are linked with the step definitions

    we have to write the code/script in the step definition itself

    test runner -
    we use junit-cucumber to run our tests
    cucumber options to provide multiple customizable options

    features - path to all the feature files
    glue - to provide the path of step def package
    dry run - to generate missing step def, when we set it to true, it will generate
    all the step def
    tags - to execute scenarios of our choice, we can use different tags in scenarios

    we use OR keyword in tags to execute either scenario A or scenario B
    (ScenarioA or ScenarioB)
    we use AND keyword in tags to execute the scenario having both conditions true
    (scenarioA and scenarioB), only the test case having both tags will be executed


    login scenario -
        admin login
        ess login
        invalid login

    Background - when the flow of all the scenarios is same in one feature file,
    it will execute before all the scenarios.
    it will be limited to one feature file.
    for every feature file, there will be different background

config.prop - to keep all the configurations related parameters in it
config reader class - read the data from .prop files
constants class - to keep all the paths from this class

Hooks - when we need to write the pre condition and post condition for the
complete project all the test cases, we use hooks.

we have 2 hooks in cucumber-
@before - pre condition of all the test cases
@after - post condition of all the test cases

Rule - we must create hooks class in steps package

Hooks vs Background -
Hooks will execute first and then background will execute
Hooks is same for all the feature file but background is different for all the feature file

order of execution -
first hooks will execute
then background will execute
then test scenario
then hooks will execute

class 4 -

recap -

in the framework, we should not pass any data hard coded -
to pass data we have config.properties file
config reader class - here in this class, we read our data

constants - to keep all the paths of the constants classes and file, we use this class

Background - in one feature file, when the flow is same for all the scenarios, you just
keep these similar steps in background, it is limited to one feature file

Hooks - we have 2 hooks,
@Before - pre condition for the complete project
@After - post condition for the complete project

Hooks must be declared in steps package

test runner -
features,
glue,
dryRun,
tags,
plugin - pretty
monochrome - true

we need to write a function for screenshot which will save my screenshot for all the
test cases with different names so that it will not be overridden

screenshot method in cucumber - here it accepts array of byte for pictures

POM - page object model design pattern
for every screen/page in the application, we create a separate class for it and
keep all the locators/WebElements of this page in this class and we create a key of
locators which we will pass in every step.

class 5 -
recap -
test runner class -

POM - page object model design pattern -

framework characteristics -

it should be easily understandable
it should be expandable
it should be easy to maintain

we created loginpage, employeesearchpage, dashboardpage, addemployeepage

data driven testing - when your one test case executes against multiple set of data

Class 6 -
recap -
we passed data from feature file itself to add one employee

scenario - just a test case
scenario-outline - with examples table - we pass key and value
we implemented POM in all the pages - we setup page initializer class too

we use assertions to verify verification and validation checkpoints
majorly we work with assertEquals and assertTrue for our test cases
this assert class comes from org.junit

*******innessa, please find the notes here as per your request*******

in data table - hooks and background executes just one time
in examples table - hooks and background executed as many times as data set

data table is applicable for just one step
examples table is applicable for one complete scenario

verification is checking the existence of element
validation is checking the functionality of the element

in cucumber framework you can add employees using multiple ways
using hardcoded data
using string  value from feature
using examples table in scenario outline
using data table in feature file
using excel files


in excel file - we have 2 types of extensions
.xls - HSSF workbook
.xlsx - XSSF workbook

class 7
recap -
 examples table and data table -

 in data table, we use scenario instead of scenario outline
 data table is limited to one step but examples table works for all the scenario

 in data table, we don't use examples key word and we don't pass keys in the step

 hooks execute one time, background executes one time and scenario executes based on data set

 adding the employees using excel file -
 excel reader class to read the data from excel file
 verified the employee has been added

why reports - it is an artifact/proof that you have executed the scenario
it gives you detailed information, how many test cases passed and failed

html report - will be generated once you execute your code from runner class
to open the report - right click on the report - select open in - select browser - chrome

json report - we have to add plugin in runner class


here in every framework - we need one point of execution and here this  point is
pom.xml file (we add dependency, we add runner class, we add plugin, we execute)

to execute runner class from pom.xml file, we need plugin (maven surefire plugin)


build success message means your code is working fine and you can proceed further
everytime we must execute test cases using pom.xml file

to generate the report from pom.xml file, we need to add a plugin called
maven cucumber reporting plugin

we are generating the report without screenshot but we need screenshot for all test cases

at the last step I will capture the screenshot
so that even if it is passed or failed, it will give me that page

there is a class in cucumber called Scenario class
this scenario class from cucumber holds the complete information of your execution

log 4j - it is a log file which we use for local execution related information
log4j.xml file is responsible to integrate/add log messages into your framework
log is the class in which you write all the methods
DOM configurator is the place where you provide the path of log4j file
and then you call all the methods to print your messages

75-80 (success rate of automation)
100 - 80 will be passed - 20 will be failed (example)

rerun plugin we use to create failed.txt file
this file has all the failed test cases which we can run from failed runner class

class 8 -
recap -
reporting -
runner class - html report -
runner class - json report -
cucumber maven reporting plugin from pom.xml file

log4j - we added dependency in pom.xml file
and we created log4j.xml file to generate logs/to integrate logs
and we created Log class to write all the methods which one we need to use
then we call DOMConfigurator and methods in steps which will print
my execution logs in logfile.log

failed.txt - rerun plugin in runner class - the path of failed.txt file which
will be created after execution and it has the path of all failed scenarios
and then we create failedrunner class to run only failed test cases

report with screenshot -
take screenshot - pattern - for taking unique ss everytime
Hooks - post condition -
passed and failed folder for ss -
Scenario class in cucumber - it holds the complete information about execution
using array of byte - attaching the screenshot in the report
scenario.attach is the method we use for ss attach

maven -

lifecycle - phases in maven
compile - source code converts into binary code
package - code will be packaged into jars (developers use this part)
install - jars will be installed to local repo
deploy - here  jars will  be transferred to remote repo
clean - it deletes target folder
test - your code will be tested

clean
compile
install
package
test
